### Best practices

The best practices for managing the project on the long run rely around
respecting folder structure. This means:

1. Add `.tsx` files on `components` folder only
1. Add preact hooks on `sdk` folder.
1. To make a component editable, create it on the `components` folder and add an
   `export { default }` on the `sections` folder
1. To add JavaScript to the browser, create a component on the `components`
   folder and add an `export { default }` on the islands folder

Check performance best practices on
[deco.cx's docs](https://www.deco.cx/docs).
